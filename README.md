Java Web Service Development â€“ Event Search and Ticket Recommendation  
====
*	Designed an interactive web page for users utilizing AJAX technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
*	Created Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses; Designed logics and algorithms 
to implement event search and content-based ticket recommendation
*	Built MySQL and NoSQL databases (MongoDB) to capture data from TicketMaster API and store user behavior history
*	Deployed server to Amazon Linux EC2 instance to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter. 
*	Used ELK to analyze geographic distribution of users; Processed logs with MapReduce in MongoDB to find peak periods.
